# Azure Storage Backup

A single-user, no-authentication application that backs up local files to an Azure Storage account (Blob only).

## Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 10 Minimal API + EF Core (SQLite) + Azure.Storage.Blobs
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Packaging**: a single multi-arch Docker image (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) in which the backend serves both the API and the built frontend. Compression uses 7-Zip (`p7zip-full`) bundled in the image.

## Local development

**Backend** (port 5122):

```bash
cd backend
dotnet run --project src/AzureStorageBackup.Api
```

**Frontend** (port 5173; `/api` is proxied to the backend by Vite):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && dotnet test
```

Integration tests that talk to Azure use [Azurite](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite); they are skipped automatically when Azurite is not reachable on `127.0.0.1:10000`.

## Docker

The image is self-contained: the backend hosts the API and the compiled SPA on **one** HTTP port (`8080`). Rehydration of Archive-tier blobs, 7-Zip compression, restore and repair all run inside this container, so the host directories you want to back up (and restore into) must be mounted.

Build and run locally:

```bash
docker build -t azurestoragebackup .
docker run -d --name asb -p 8080:8080 \
  -e ConnectionStrings__AzureStorage="<your Azure Storage connection string>" \
  -v asb-data:/data -v asb-keys:/keys -v asb-temp:/temp \
  -v /path/to/files:/backup-source \
  azurestoragebackup
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>. Inside the app, set a backup's *local root* (and any restore target) to a path that exists **inside the container**, e.g. `/backup-source`.

Or with Docker Compose (`docker compose up --build`), after copying `.env.example` to `.env`.

### Environment variables

ASP.NET Core maps nested config keys with a double underscore (`Section__Key`). All are optional; defaults shown are the in-container defaults set by the image.

| Variable | Purpose | Default (image) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ConnectionStrings__AzureStorage` | Azure Storage account connection string. If empty, falls back to `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` (local Azurite) so the process still starts. | *(empty)* |
| `ConnectionStrings__Sqlite` | SQLite connection string (app database). | `Data Source=/data/app.db` |
| `DataProtection__KeysPath` | Directory for the Data Protection key ring used to encrypt secrets at rest (account keys, backup passwords). **Must be persisted** — losing it makes stored secrets undecryptable. | `/keys` |
| `Backup__TempPath` | Working area root: compression, staging, restore, check, dead-weight compaction, and verbose logs live under here. Can grow large during a backup/restore. | `/temp` |
| `Backup__StagedLimitBytes` | Max bytes kept in the staging area before back-pressure. | `1073741824` (1 GiB) |
| `Scheduler__Enabled` | Enable the cron scheduler for scheduled backup/check/cleanup tasks. | `true` |
| `Scheduler__TimeZone` | IANA time-zone id used to evaluate cron expressions. | `UTC` |
| `Cors__AllowedOrigins__0` | Allowed browser origin. Not needed for the single-image deployment (frontend is same-origin); relevant only when hosting the SPA separately. | `http://localhost:5173` |
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS` | Listen address. | `http://+:8080` |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | ASP.NET environment. | `Production` |

### Volumes / mounts

| Container path | Purpose | Persist? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/data` | SQLite database (`app.db`). | **Yes** |
| `/keys` | Data Protection key ring. Losing it makes stored account keys/passwords undecryptable. | **Yes** |
| `/temp` | Backup/restore working area (compress, staged, restore, check, compact, verbose logs). Safe to discard, but needs free space. | Optional (needs disk space) |
| *(your choice, e.g. `/backup-source`)* | Host directories to back up. Mount **read-only** if you only back up. A backup's *local root* is set to this in-container path. | Bind mount |
| *(your choice, e.g. `/restore-target`)* | Where restores write. Mount read-write. | Bind mount |

`GET /api/system/paths` returns the resolved absolute paths at runtime (PRD §6 "Directories"), useful when configuring Docker volume mappings.

## Published image (GHCR)

Multi-arch images are published to the GitHub Container Registry:

```
ghcr.io/secretnest/azurestoragebackup:latest
```

Publishing is a **manual** GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`) that builds for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` with Buildx and pushes to GHCR.

## Documentation

Roadmap: `docs/roadmap.md`. Full requirements: `docs/product-requirements.md`. Backup engine design: `docs/m4-backup-engine-design.md`.
